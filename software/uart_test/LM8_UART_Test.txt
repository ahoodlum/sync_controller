This example exercises Wishbone UART's transmit/receive
functionality by directly accessing the UART drivers(in
lieu of stdin/stdout).

PREREQUISITES:
--------------
1. LatticeMico8 connected to a UART.  This example assumes
   the UART instance is named "uart".  If it is not true,
   it must be changed to reflect the instance-name by
   changing the uart_core_uart to uart_core_<instance_name> 
   in LM8_Uart_Test source file.
2. GPIO with 4-bit output named "LED" connected to the         
   board's LED pins.  
   (LM8 Platform A)
   
USAGE:
------
To use this demo, connect a serial cable between the demo
board and a PC.  Start hyperterminal on the PC and select
the appropriate serial port (typically COM<n> where <n> is
a numeric value (e.g. COM1, COM6 etc).

Configure the serial port connection to 115200 bits/second
with 8-data bits, no parity and no flow control.

The following message will be shown in the hyperterminal:

-- MAIN MENU --
0 - Terminate Session
1 - Uart Echo Test
2 - Toggle LEDs
>

Type 0, 1 or 2 on hyperterminal; LatticeMico8 will terminate, or 
do uart echo test or toggle LEDs.
